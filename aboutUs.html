            <p class="abt-us-txt">R&R's Eggciting Eggs began in 2016, on  a small lifestyle block when a young boy was
                surprised by his parents with some chicks from the animal shelter. Every day he fed them, gave them
                water and took good care of them. A year later, the chickens started laying eggs, and the boy had an
                idea - "Why don't I sell the eggs?" And with that one question, R&R's Eggciting eggs began.</p>
